Textures for Data Storage
Diana Southard
CSCI 5239 Spring 2016

#### Directions

Create a program using GLSL that uses textures for data storage.

#### Program Use Instructions
Use the dropdown menus to select between the following options:
- Shader: 
	* *None:* Displays desired object with no shader applied
	* *Animated 2D Perlin Noise:* Displays object with animated 2D Perlix noise shader applied to it.
	* *Animated 2D Simplex Noise:* Displays object with animated 2D Simplex noise shader applied to it.


- Projection: Orthogonal or Perspective
- Object: Cube, Teapot, or Cruiser, or Bunny.


Using the mouse, the object can be rotated by dragging with the right mouse button. Subsequent angles of rotation will be displayed below the positioning sliders. The scene can also be zoomed in/out by using the mouse wheel or scrolling with a touchpad, with the resulting zoom level also displayed.


The scene is lit by a rotating sphere which can be paused using the "Pause" button. Once paused, the button is renamed to "Animate" which will resume the sphere's rotation. Additionally, the light's elevation can be adjusted using the Light Elevation slider.


All object angle adjustments can be reset by clicking on the "Reset" button on the bottom left of the menu. This will restore the object to its original angle position.


Use the Quit button or the window's exit button to end the program.


**Time To Complete Assignment:** ~8 hours

Based on provided class Example 17.
